This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Kids Collection & E-commerce Optimization

The Kids Collection section has been optimized for both psychological appeal and e-commerce performance:

### Color Psychology
- **Kids-focused colors**: Bright, energetic colors (yellow, orange) to appeal to children
- **Parent-focused colors**: Calm, trustworthy colors (blue, green) to appeal to parents
- **Trust indicators**: Using green for savings and blue for authority elements

### Animation Effects
- **Floating animations**: Gentle movements to attract children's attention without overwhelming
- **Pulse animations**: Subtle highlighting of important elements like discounts
- **Hover effects**: Interactive elements that respond to user interaction

### Psychological Triggers
- **Social proof**: Showing reviews and popularity indicators
- **Scarcity**: Limited time offers that appear after a delay
- **Authority**: Expert recommendations from a "stylist"
- **Reciprocity**: Free coloring sheets with purchase
- **FOMO**: "Best value" and "Popular with kids" indicators

### SEO Optimization
- **Structured data**: Product schema markup for rich results in search
- **Meta tags**: Optimized title, description and keywords
- **Open Graph tags**: For better social media sharing

### Marketplace Integration
- **Amazon & Flipkart links**: Direct links to the same products on major marketplaces
- **Tracking**: Analytics for user behavior and conversion tracking
- **Product IDs**: Consistent product identifiers across platforms

### CTA Optimization
- **Hierarchy**: Primary and secondary action buttons with clear visual distinction
- **Color psychology**: Using orange (urgency) for primary actions and blue (trust) for secondary
- **Microcopy**: Using emojis and concise text to encourage interaction

All of these elements work together to create a shopping experience that appeals to both children (with fun, animated elements) and parents (with trust signals and educational value), while being optimized for discoverability through search engines and marketplaces.
