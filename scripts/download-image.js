// This script is a placeholder reminder
// For the actual deployment, you need to:
// 1. Save the beach image uploaded in the chat
// 2. Rename it to "IMG_0054.jpeg" (or use the original filename)
// 3. Place it in the public folder of your Next.js project
//
// Since the Claude AI assistant can't directly download and save the image,
// you'll need to do this step manually.
// 
// Note: Make sure the image is in the public directory with the name "IMG_0054.jpeg"
// so that the CSS background-image URL will work correctly.
